# K-Means
This is an implementation of k-means algorithm. The data points cartesian coordinates are given in Points.txt file.

We first cluster the points using their cartesian coordinates. But the results of the clustering is not desirable. To get the desirable results we transform the coordinates to polar coordinates. As the results show, this yields desirable results.
